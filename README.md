# Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator

## Project Overview

The Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator is a Python-based application designed to compute various statistical metrics for a 3x3 matrix of numerical data. This application allows users to input their matrix either as a whole or row by row, and it utilizes the NumPy library to efficiently calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum for both rows and columns, as well as for the flattened matrix. By providing these statistical insights, users can better understand the characteristics of the data they are working with.

## Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language used to implement the statistical calculations and user interactions.
NumPy: A powerful library for numerical computations in Python, utilized for handling matrix operations and statistical functions.
User Input Handling: The application allows users to interactively enter their data, making it versatile and user-friendly.
This project serves as an educational tool for those interested in understanding basic statistics and using Python for data analysis. It provides users with a practical understanding of how to perform statistical calculations programmatically.
